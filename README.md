## Description
Guess my number is a 1 player game designed to demonstrate and showcase my Javascript, HTML and CSS skills. The game asks the player to make a guess between 1 and 20. 

Each time the guess is wrong then the player looses a point until either they guess the correct numer or run out of points.

The game has been styled in a retro 90's arcade game style to make it more relevant.
